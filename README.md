Create reverse proxy configs via web interface!

## About

Traefik is a reverse proxy with a strong focus on container orchestration plaforms. Beside that it also supports
dynamic configuration via file input. This addon provides a beautiful web interface to create the
dynamic configuration for you.

By using this addon you agree to the TOS of lets encrypt.

### Features

* üîí HTTPS by default (provided by lets encrypt)
* üîí HTTP to HTTPS redirect
* üîí HSTS
* üî† Custom request headers
* üóùÔ∏è Basic auth
* üö™ IP restriction

## Configuration
```
loglevel: error
email: webmaster@example.ch
httpreq:
  url: ''
  username: ''
  password: ''
insecureSkipVerify: false
rootCAs: []
```
### Option: ```loglevel```
The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `error`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: ```email```
The `email` option is required for the registration with the lets encrypt service.

### Option: ```httpreq```
This option sets the necessary variables and cert resolver to dns01.
Please refer the official documentation from traefik for further details https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#dnschallenge

### Option: ```insecureSkipVerify```
Skip verification of ssl certs on backends. Useful if you proxy to a tls/ssl backend with a self signed certificate
Try to leave this settings to `false` and provide necessary root CAs.
Please refer the official documentation from traefik for further details https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/overview/#insecureskipverify

### Option: ```rootCAs```
Specifies a list of root CAs as base64 strings to import in traefik.
